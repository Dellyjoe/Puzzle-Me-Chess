\section{Project description}
In chess there are many different ways to play the game. After each player moves three times there are 121 million different moves that can end the game. Many people need to practice chess in order to get better and there are many ways to do this. You can play over the internet and play computer which range from (400 - 3200) EIO or you can play puzzle's in chess. Puzzle's in chess allow you to study the board in a given state and make the next several moves. This project is dedicated to solving puzzles in the physical world. 
\\

\noindent The physical chess puzzle allows the user to practice looking at a physical board to solve each puzzle. This project is titled "Puzzle me Chess`` and it will be equipped to have 3 different puzzle's. The chess board will allow the user to place each piece in the right location that is displayed on the OLED screen. After each piece is on the board the chess puzzle will then display to the user which color he/she will play. After the user makes his first move the board will check to see if the move was correct. If not the user will be asked to reset the piece and try again until puzzle is complete. 

\subsection{Capabilities}
Capabilites for the Puzzle me Chess project range from Indicators, User Direction, SD card capability, and Location Detection. See below for more details. 

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    Capability  & Description below\\ \hline
    Indicator &  LED light indicator to show user hint/show answer feature \\ \hline
    User Direction & OLED to describe to the user where to put pieces \\ \hline 
    SD Card & Read .csv standardized format to quickly import puzzles \\ \hline
    User Direction & User input switch to show user answer, indicated by LEDs \\ \hline
    User Direction & User input Button to show user a hint \\ \hline
    Location Detection & Check board spots are correct for puzzle that was selected \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
 *Assume User puts right pieces on spot 
 \newline
 *Assume Chess Board will be lit evenly with light  
\subsection{Limitations}
Limitations for the Puzzle me Chess project range from Location Detection, Auto Movement, Puzzle Selection, Physical and parts. See below for more details.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    Limitations  & Description below\\ \hline
    Location Detection & Not knowing which piece is on the spot \\ \hline
    Auto Movement & Not being able to move the piece on correct spot \\ \hline 
    Puzzle Selection & Not having 3+ different puzzles to choose from  \\ \hline
    Physical & Not being able to light each square along the perimeter  \\ \hline
    Parts & Not having multiple colors to indicate wrong or right answer \\ \hline
    Physical & Needing light to illuminate  the chess board \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Functional description}
The Puzzle me Chess project will feature a microcontroller, one 21x21 wooden chess board, 8 Multiplexers, 1 switch, 1 Potentiometer, 1 button, and A Display. Figure \ref{fig:Circuit} shows  the current circuit layout as of 02/16/2021, this circuit doesn't show the chess board. Explanation of the System Block Diagram to follow.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Circuit layout as of 02/16/2021}
  \label{fig:Circuit}
\end{figure}

\subsection{System Block Diagram}
Figure \ref{fig:SBD1} shows the sudo hand drawn block diagram. The project consist of One Microcontroller which will feature the teensy 3.6, 8 Multiplexer's from Texas Instruments part \# CD4051BE, 1 basic breadboard switch, 1 breadboard Potentiometer, 1 basic breadbaord button, LED's, Photoresister's, 1 Chess Board and one Display. 
\\


\noindent The Chess board will have 1 LED and 1 photoresister per block. The LED will be drilled and placed on the top left side of each block and will be used to show the user where to place each piece. The photoresister will be drilled in the middle of each block and will be used as a voltage drop to tell if there is a piece there or not. See section multiplexer circuit diagram for the circuit layout.

% Figure \ref{fig:boat1} shows a boat.

\subsection{Multiplexer Circuit Diagram} 
Figure \ref{fig:MSCD} shows the sudo circuit for Muxltiplexer A, the puzzle me chess project will consist of 8 Muxltiplexer one for each column A-H. Each of the Muxltiplexers will have 8 outgoing lines that will read Voltages levels from the column and rows \# 1-8. Each row will have one resister which will be $~2M \Omega$ and one Photoresister in series. Each Photoresister has two modes a light and a dark mode. Equation
\\


Assume Light; R = $500 \Omega$
\\


Assume Dark; R = $1M \Omega$


\begin{equation}
Light
$$ V = IR, 3.3VDC = I*(2M + 500)$\Omega$ $$
$$ I = 1.65$\mu$A, Vlight = 825$\mu$VDC, Mux input would see 3.299VDC if no piece on top of photoresister$$
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Dark
$$ V = IR, 3.3VDC = I*3.3M$\Omega$ $$
$$ I = 1.1$\mu$A, Vdark = 1.1VDC, Mux input would see 2.2VD  if piece was placed on block$$
